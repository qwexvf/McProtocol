  This represents a packet being received from a Server or Client.

  This abstraction ensures that a packet is only decoded if it's actually needed. A proxy
  could look at the packet type, if it doesn't need to touch it, it could send on the raw
  data without even decoding it.

  Even if there are several layers calling fetch_packet/1, this also ensures that the
  packet data is only decoded once. If fetch_packet/1 is never called, the packet is never
  decoded.
